# Contianers
Bism Ellah Elrahman Al Raheem


# Specifications:

1-Turn files into:
	
	ft_vector.hpp
	ft_map.hpp
	ft_stack.hpp
2-Implement:

	std::iterator_triats
	std::reverse_iterators
	std::enable_if
	std::is_integral
	std::equal and/or std::lexicographical_compare
	std::pair
	std::make_pair
3-Implement public functions as the std, every thing else must be private or protected
4-Implement member, nonmember functions, overloads
5-Must follow original naming exactly
6-Implement iterators vectors and map
7-Must use std::allocator
8-For non member function the friend use is allowed
9-In map std::map::value_compare allowed
10-Produce two test binaries?
11-Compare outputs and timing, Can be up to 20 times slower than std::contianer?
	
# Questions:
-What is the difference bettween vector, map and stack
-What is std:iterator_triats?
-What are std::reverese_iterators?

-What is lexicographical_compare(comparing alphabitically)
-What is std::is_integral?
-What is std::equal?
-What is std::pari?
-What is std::make_pair?
-What is the use and functionality of all of the above, why do we need them, how will Earth look like without them?
-What is std::allocator, why and how to use it?
-What are the member and non member functions of vectors, maps, stack?
-What is friend, and who is my friend>
-What is std::map::value_compare
-How to make the test that compare the leaks and time?
